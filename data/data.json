        "<strong>Founder’s Message</strong> </br> </br> I founded Shaker International Monetary Fund (Shaker IMF) with a simple but unwavering belief: one person, guided by integrity and service, can still change the world—and can do so for millions, not for power, profit, or recognition, but for people.",
        "Throughout modern history, financial systems have too often failed those they were meant to serve. Nations have been trapped in cycles of debt. Communities have been held back by poverty. Natural environments have been sacrificed for short-term gain. Corruption has diverted resources away from the people who needed them most. I did not create Shaker IMF to become another institution within this system. I created it to challenge the assumption that finance must benefit a few instead of serving the many.",
        "Shaker IMF is a private, independent institution built on the principle that finance, when guided by ethics and transparency, can be a force for dignity, stability, and hope. We do not seek fees. We do not accept donations. We do not charge interest. We do not pursue profit, benefit, or influence through our partnerships. We are not here to do business. We are here to serve people. This commitment is not symbolic—it is structural. It defines how Shaker IMF operates, who we partner with, and what we will never compromise.",
        "I believe deeply that serving people is serving God. This belief does not belong to one religion, one nation, or one culture. It belongs to humanity. It means standing with those who have been unheard, supporting leaders who wish to act with integrity, and refusing to participate in systems that reward corruption, exploitation, or dependency.",
        "Shaker IMF exists to support national leaderships, not to control them; to help nations exit debt traps, not to replace one form of dependency with another; and to reduce poverty, not manage it. We work to strengthen economic resilience, address financial and environmental challenges together, and help build systems that allow communities and countries to stand on their own with dignity.",
        "This institution is my vision, but it is not about me. It is about what becomes possible when courage replaces fear, when service replaces self-interest, and when integrity becomes non-negotiable. I invite leaders, institutions, and partners who share these values to walk this path with us.",
        "The world does not lack resources. It lacks clean intent. Shaker IMF exists to restore that intent—one nation, one community, one life at a time.",
